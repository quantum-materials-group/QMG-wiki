Writing your thesis with LaTeX + VS Code
========================================

- Download TeX Live by going to https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html and click on "install-tl-windows.exe".

- Once downloaded then run it as admin to start the install. Click through all the default options and install, should take several hours.

- Meanwhile, download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/

- In VS Code, install the following extensions: 
    - Code Spell Checker (Street Side Software)
    - LaTeX Utilities (tecosaur)
    - LaTeX Workshop (James Yu)

- Download the "UTS PhD template" folder from here.

- Once TeX has finished installing, start VS Code and open the UTS PhD template folder. Select ``dissertation_main.tex`` and go to the bottom "TeX" tab on the right, then hit "Build LaTeX project". 

- Don't forget to back up your thesis folder somewhere, e.g. OneDrive, Z drive, desktop, github (probably there is a way to use VS Code to sync with github)
