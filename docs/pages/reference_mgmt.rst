Managing references
===================

Throughout your time in the group, you will be reading many journal articles, PhD theses, textbooks, and experimental equipment user manuals. 
When it comes time to write a draft manuscript for a paper, or when writing your thesis, there are a few options available for keeping track of references.

Here are some resources to consider:

- `Zotero <https://www.zotero.org>`_

- `Mendeley <https://www.mendeley.com>`_

- `EndNote <https://www.endnote.com/>`_

- `Research Rabbit <https://www.researchrabbit.ai>`_

Once you start getting published, it is a good idea to setup your own professional presence online, so that others can cite you more easily.
Quite often researchers have at least one of the following:

- `Google Scholar <https://scholar.google.com.au/>`_

- `ORCID <https://www.orcid.org>`_
