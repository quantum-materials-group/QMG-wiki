Ross Milbourne Sports Hall Booking

Overview

Once in a while when Supreme Leader Igor permits non-laboratory-based activities so the group may exercise.

The sports hall can facilitate sports games for team building purposes and for good health.

The halls are extremely popular and must be booked well in advance during the semester. 

The RMSH is located in Building 4B.


Facilities include:

- a full sized basketball court

- a dance studio

- a gymnasium

The basketball court can be split into 3 smaller courts but for full fun make sure to book the full court (Court 1, Court 2 and Court 3)
